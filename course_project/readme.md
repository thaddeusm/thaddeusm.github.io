- Trying to stream from Soundcloud locally will result in a warning on Chrome.  Instead, you can run a local node server for testing.
- Changes were made after you and Jasmine brought up compatibility issues with other browsers.  I have tested the lastest version of my code on Chrome, Safari, and Firefox.
