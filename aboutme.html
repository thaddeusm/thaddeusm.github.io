				<p>My name is Thaddeus and I am based in Joplin, Missouri, USA.  I am an educator in the field of Second Language Acquisition (SLA) and am currently teaching ESL online on <a class="regular-link" href="https://www.italki.com/teacher/493889" target="_blank">italki</a>.</p>

				<p>I recently completed two consecutive <a class="regular-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dvg2CwTfoAA" target="_blank">English Language Fellowships in Ukraine</a> with the US Department of State where my work included planning and leading professional development workshops for language educators.  One major topic was the use of technology in education.  I attempted to develop and present <a class="regular-link" href="http://www.enupgrade.com/resources.html" target="_blank">examples</a> that would either meet the immediate needs of educators or demonstrate applications of trends in SLA research (or, ideally, both).  The experience was humbling because I needed to not only resolve my gaps in understanding of modern web development, but also become more familiar with the limitations of educators and learners throughout Eastern Europe.  It was this struggle that led me to search for an opportunity to further explore web development for educational settings.</p>

				<p>I am a student in the University of Missouri's Educational Specialist program for Learning Systems Design and Development.  I chose this program specifically because I feel I cannot begin to build my portfolio without first addressing gaps in my technical abilities.  For the last two years I have used <a class="regular-link" href="http://www.freecodecamp.com/" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp</a>, <a class="regular-link" href="http://www.watchandcode.com/" target="_blank">Practical Javascript</a>, and <a class="regular-link" href="http://www.onemonth.com/" target="_blank">OneMonth</a> to build basic web development skills while  creating simple applications for immediate use in education.  In my opinion, many online courses and tutorials are constructed largely in consideration of learners who are put off by traditional educational settings.  Each of the three resources helped me get unstuck in their own way, but I am interested in seeing how semester-based courses might help me become more disciplined.</p>
