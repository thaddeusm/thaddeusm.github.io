				<p>My name is Thaddeus and I will be participating in this course from Neosho, Missouri.  I am an educator in the field of Second Language Acquisition (SLA) and a graduate of MU College of Education's graduate TESOL program.  I am currently working as an ESL Instructor with Crowder College.</p>

				<p>I recently completed two consecutive <a class="regular-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dvg2CwTfoAA" target="_blank">English Language Fellowships in Ukraine</a>. with the US Department of State where my work included planning and leading professional development workshops for language educators.  One major topic was the use of technology in education.  I attempted to develop and present <a class="regular-link" href="http://www.enupgrade.com/resources.html" target="_blank">examples</a>. that would either meet the immediate needs of educators or demonstrate applications of trends in SLA research (or, ideally, both).  The experience was humbling because I needed to not only resolve my gaps in understanding of modern web development, but also become more familiar with the limitations of educators and learners throughout Eastern Europe.  It was this struggle that led me to search for an opportunity to further explore web development for educational settings.</p>

				<p>This is my first semester in the EdSpec LSDD program, so I chose this course specifically because I feel I cannot begin to build my portfolio or consider research opportunities without first addressing gaps in my technical abilities.  For the last two years I have used <a class="regular-link" href="http://www.freecodecamp.com/" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp</a>, <a class="regular-link" href="http://www.watchandcode.com/" target="_blank">Practical Javascript</a>, and <a class="regular-link" href="http://www.onemonth.com/" target="_blank">OneMonth</a> to build basic web development skills while  creating simple applications for immediate use in education.  In my opinion, many online courses and tutorials are constructed largely in consideration of learners who are put off by traditional educational settings.  Each of the three resources helped me get unstuck in their own way, but I am interested in seeing how a semester-based course such as this might help me become more disciplined.</p>

				<p>Throughout this program I will also investigate possibilities for a career transition from classroom teaching to web development.  I am planning to complete the entire FreeCodeCamp trajectory (which includes data visualization and backend development with Node) at the same time in hopes of having both a solid practical and theoretical foundation to demonstrate through portfolio samples, technical interview challenges, and a clearly stated purpose.</p>

				<p><a class="regular-link" href="https://codepen.io/thaddeusm/" target="_blank">My CodePen portfolio</a> includes some projects I completed through FreeCodeCamp and I have some full stack examples on <a class="regular-link" href="https://github.com/thaddeusm" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.  I look forward to receiving (and giving) feedback and collaborating with many of you!</p>
